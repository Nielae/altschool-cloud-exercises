## BEEFING UP MY SECURITY WITH CIS BENCHMARK
### These are the steps taken to strengthen my security 
##### Honestly, i can barely remember all the steps i took to do this. I need to do better with my documentation. 
 <br>
STEPS:
    <ol>
        <li> I googled "cis benchmark" as i do not know the correct web address, the result came up and i chose the first link with "www.cissecurity.org"     </li>
        <li> Scrolled down the page briefly till i saw the different software tabs, clicked on "operating software", this brought out other tabs and i chose linux. This prompted the system to show me only linux OS. I chose ubuntu linux and clicked on the "Download CIS benchmark" button.     </li>
        <li> I was directed to another page where i had to fill a form and click on "Get free benchmarks now" </li> 
        <li> An email was sent to the mail i had put in, giving me access to download the pdf file. I downloaded the file for ubuntu 20.04  </li>  
    </ol>
<br>
<p> The following below are some of the security measures I have put in place using the pdf as my guiding tool  </p>

<ol> <li> Ensure mounting of cramfs filesystems is disabled (Automated) </li> 

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS1.png "Ensure mounting of cramfs filesystems is disabled (Automated)") 

 <li> Ensure mounting of freevxfs filesystems is disabled (Automated) </li>  

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS2.png "Ensure mounting of freevxfs filesystems is disabled (Automated)") 

 <li> Ensure mounting of jffs2 filesystems is disabled (Automated) </li> 

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS3.png "Ensure mounting of jffs2 filesystems is disabled (Automated)") 

 <li> Ensure mounting of hfs filesystems is disabled (Automated) </li>  

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS4.png "Ensure mounting of hfs filesystems is disabled (Automated)") 

 <li> Ensure mounting of hfsplus filesystems is disabled (Automated) </li> 

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS5.png "Ensure mounting of hfsplus filesystems is disabled (Automated)") 

 <li> Ensure mounting of udf filesystems is disabled (Automated) </li> 

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS6.png "Ensure mounting of udf filesystems is disabled (Automated)") 

 <li> Disable Automounting (Automated) </li> 

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS7.png "Disable Automounting (Automated)") 

 <li> Ensure package manager repositories are configured (Manual) </li> 

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS8.png "Ensure package manager repositories are configured (Manual)") 

 <li> Ensure GPG keys are configured (Manual)) </li>  

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS9.png "Ensure GPG keys are configured (Manual)") 

 <li> Ensure permissions on bootloader config are not overridden (Automated) </li> 

![etc/apt/sources.list](../Images/CIS10.png "Ensure permissions on bootloader config are not overridden (Automated)") 



<p> That is the end of exercise Six. THE END.
