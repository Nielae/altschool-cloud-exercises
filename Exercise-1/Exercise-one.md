### This is exercise 1, showing the result of "ifconfig"
The steps taken to achieve this are as follows:
<ol>
    <li> I installed VM and Vagrant. I didnt need to install git bash as i already had it </li>
    <li> Opened my git bash, ran mkdir to create new directories while using cd to enter the path </li>
    <li> I ran vagrant init Ubuntu20.04/focal 64, This downloaded all the necessary and installed Ubuntu20.04 </li>
    <li> Did vagrant up </li>
    <li> My path changed and became vagrant@ubuutu20.04/focal64 </li>
    <li> Opened nano Vagrantfile which took me to the vagrant file, changed my private network to type: "dhcp" , saved my work and ran ifconfig on the terminal </li>
    <li> The screenshot of "ifconfig" is this: </li>
</ol>
